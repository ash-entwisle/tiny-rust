# Small Hello-World Docker Container

I did this as a test to see how small I can get a Docker container to be. 
This container clocks in at a whopping 1.8MB in size using rust and busybox (musl). 
Even though its not the smallest hello world container, its still 1000 times smaller than the base NodeJS container.
